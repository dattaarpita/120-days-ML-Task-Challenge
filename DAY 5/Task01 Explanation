"""Set is faster than list. Because in list,values are assigned orderly through indexing.If we search something in list,it checks one by one index ,so time complexity is O(N).In the case of set,values are assigned using hash table.If we store something in set,python computes its hash value and assign number in that slot.While storing in set,set doen't maintain order rather than store that number in its designated slot.So when we search something in set, that number  directly hits its hash tables value. So it takes less time, faster than list.O(1)
